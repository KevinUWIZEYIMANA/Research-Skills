                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    This course module was introduced to me to the core principles and practices of academic and applied research. As a student pursuing a carreer in Project Management, I found this module very important as it provided me with the necessary skills to conduct research effectively. The course covered a wide range of topics, including the nature of research, the role of research in Project Management, and the process of developing a research proposal. I learned how to formulate research topics, create problem statements, and establish research objectives and questions. Additionally, the course emphasized the importance of literature reviews and referencing styles, which are essential for grounding research in existing knowledge.

                <h4>What I learned</h4>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this course, I gained valuable skills such as understanding different research methodologies including qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods that help to analyse data.
                    </p>
                <h4>Challenges faced</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the main challenges I faced during this course is the formation of the research topic. At first, It was difficult to know how to structure research topic which only inphasises on only two variables and also which has a contribution in the field of Project Management. However, with the help of my instructor and the resources provided, I was able to overcome this challenge and develop a clear and focused research topic. 
                    </p>
                <h4>how it helped me</h4>
                    <p>
                        This course has helped me to develop a more structured approach to research. I have learned how to effectively narrow down my research questions and focus on specific aspects of Project Management. The skills I gained in literature review and referencing have also improved the quality of my work. Overall, this course has equipped me with the tools I need to conduct research more confidently and effectively.
                    </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, this course has been very important in helping me understand how research works, especially in the field of Project Management. I have learned how to ask the right questions, collect useful information, and analyze data in a way that helps with solving real-world problems. The skills I gained—like writing research proposals, reviewing literature, and using tools like Excel and Google Forms—will be very helpful in my academic work and future career.

This module also helped me improve in areas I found difficult, such as understanding data and managing my time during a research project. Now, I feel more confident in my ability to do research on my own. I believe this experience has prepared me well for bigger tasks like my final year project and for making smart, evidence-based decisions as a future project manager.

Overall, this course has given me a strong foundation in research. It showed me how research can be used to support good project planning, solve problems, and communicate clearly with others. I look forward to using everything I’ve learned in my upcoming projects and professional journey.
